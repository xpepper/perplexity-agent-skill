Excited to share my latest open-source project: Perplexity Web Research Agent Skill!

This Agent Skills package brings Perplexity's specialized reasoning models to any AI coding assistant that supports the agentskills.io standard.

🎯 Key capabilities:
• Web research with up-to-date information
• Independent validation for architecture decisions
• Deep reasoning delegation for complex problems

💡 Why it matters:
Instead of relying on MCP servers (which consume tokens), this skill uses the efficient Perplexity CLI to:
- Preserve context window space
- Execute faster
- Work anywhere bash is available

🛠️ One-line install:
npx skills add xpepper/perplexity-agent-skill

Compatible with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and 30+ other AI agents.
